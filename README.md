Homework Unit13-AWS-Lex
I have completed this homework and successfully tested.
Thanks for the timely help and tips from Instructor Metin and both the TAs - Ryan and Trevor. It has been really great help and I wouldn't have completed it without your help.

The Lex and Lamda are downloaded.

My bot, intent, and slot ZIP files are in folder:
\RoboAdvisor\13-AWS-Lex\Instructions\Results


The Videos and Screenshots showing my bot testing are in folder:
\RoboAdvisor\13-AWS-Lex\Instructions\Results

The Lamda funcion code file: lambda_function.py is in folder: 
\RoboAdvisor\13-AWS-Lex\Instructions\Starter_Files

The lambda function is enhanced and tested with all 4 test cases from folder: 
\RoboAdvisor\13-AWS-Lex\Instructions\Test_Cases

Thanks,
KS
